Following learning basic html language, I am about to create a beginner level, html coded recipe website.

This will demonstrate my understanding of html code, with takeaways on directories and folder organisation, using the command line, demonstrating use of Git and sharing commits. There will be an index page with simple external links.

(26.7.24 19:40) Project complete! After around 2 hours of work. I practised my skills in html, using the command line to configure directories and files, as well as committing to github. I enjoyed adding personality through <em> and <strong> as well as with emojis and images.
